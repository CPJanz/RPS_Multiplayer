Rock Paper Scissors Redeux! This time the player will be matched against another person in a game of rock paper scissors!

## Description of features
When a player loads the page, they will either be matched against a waiting player or begin waiting for another player to join. Once the player is paired off, they then are able to play as many rounds of rock paper scissors as they want with their record being kept.

## Purpose
This was an assignment for coding bootcamp focusing on using Firebase database functionality. 

## Possible Updates
- Timer for each throw
- Heartbeat to ensure that both players are still connected.


## Feedback
I found this assignment fairly challenging and I'm not fully satisfied with how the code turned out. Having to nest firebase calls inside one another to account for the asynchronous nature of the calls got complicated quickly which makes me think that there is an easier way to have solved this. Also I didn't really leave myself enough time to style the page at all so it's still sad looking.

I welcome any feedback on the choices I made.
